My partners favorite programming language is java because it’s the one he uses the most in classes.
I’d say my favorite programming language is Swift because I had a lot of fun learning it last semester when I took mobile app development class. It is very GUI based so that’s way different than what I’m used to

Yeah his favorite language is also the one he is most familiar with.
My favorite language is not the one I have the most experience with. The language I have the most experience with is Java and Is a close second right now
